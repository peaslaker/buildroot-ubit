		echo Generally, the Orange LED is used to signal the degree of activity.  
		echo For example in the install process, when the script is actively scanning
		echo the source material, the orange LED should flash fast.  When it is engaged
		echo in the big atomic commands for echo creating UBIFS images, it flashes slowly.
		echo When it is at a prompt, the green heartbeat is healthy, the orange heartbeat 
		echo indicates a need to intervene before rebooting because you have a brick on
